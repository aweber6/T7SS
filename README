phylogenetic trees of the species for each of the five loci.

SpeciesESXgenes		These scripts are used together to determine the whether 
			certain genes of interest are present in various species


cleaning		These scripts are used to create files that make it easy
			to hand eliminate PROKKA genes that are distant from the
			ESX loci

makeTrees		These are scripts used to create files which can be used 
			to make phylogenetic trees of each of the ESX loci
