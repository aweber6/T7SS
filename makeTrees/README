README: /home/aweber/scripts/T7SS/makeTrees

These are scripts used to create files which can be used to make phylogenetic 
trees of each of the ESX loci

Directory		Description
-----------------	--------------------------
geneTrees		scripts used to create trees for each ESX gene
			to help eliminate PROKKA genes that do not
			correspond to the ESX gene


-------------------	---------------------------
File			Description
-------------------	---------------------------
FastaEditor.py		creates a new FASTA file containing only the genes 
			supplied in a text file (one per line) and an original 
			FASTA file from which to extract these genes from

speciesGene_fasta.ipy	creates a FASTA file of each ESX gene for each species

geneAlignment.ipy	concatenates the gene/species FASTA files into one FASTA 
			for each ESX gene (containing PROKKA genes from across 
			all the species) and then aligns and trims ESXgene FASTA 
			files

locusAlignment.ipy	concatenates the alignments of all the ESX gene FASTAs
			into one FASTA file for the locus which can be used
			to create the phylogenetic trees
